<p>
	I, once, was an illustrator and painter, then in some way ceramic came and completed my work.
	Soft and sensitive to any trace, print, clay allows me to build my cabins and fragiles architectures.
	Playing with fulls, empties, equilibrium.
	<br>
	Discreet touches of colours here and there as graphic and poetic ponctuations complete the sculptures.
	<br><br>
	Far from the uproar, dizzy long grass bent by the smooth wind emerge from the rooftops,
	perched at the top of these piling cabins, forgotten shelters, childhood vestiges…
	<br>
	If my pieces make you dream, if your eyes get lost in it, if poetry operates,
	it means i'm on the right path and so are you…
